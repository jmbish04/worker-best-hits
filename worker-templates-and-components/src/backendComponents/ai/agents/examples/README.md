_This project is in active development. Join us in shaping the future of intelligent agents._

Welcome to a new paradigm in AI development. Cloudflare Agents provides the foundation for building intelligent, stateful agents that persist, think, and evolve at the edge of the network.

Read the announcement on the Cloudflare blog: [Making Cloudflare the best platform for building AI Agents](https://blog.cloudflare.com/build-ai-agents-on-cloudflare/)

## Vision

We're creating a framework where AI agents can:

- Maintain persistent state and memory
- Engage in real-time communication
- Process and learn from interactions
- Operate autonomously at global scale
- Hibernate when idle, awaken when needed

## Project Status

This project is actively evolving. Current focus areas:

### Ready for Use

- Core agent framework with state management
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- HTTP endpoints and routing
- React integration hooks
- Basic AI chat capabilities

### In Development

- Advanced memory systems
- WebRTC for audio/video
- Email integration
- Evaluation framework
- Enhanced observability
- Self-hosting guide

## Getting Started
