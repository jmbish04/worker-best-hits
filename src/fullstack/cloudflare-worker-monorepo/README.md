# Cloudflare Worker Monorepo

This directory contains a modern Cloudflare Worker monorepo that showcases best practices for full-stack worker development. The structure is inspired by the `react-workers-template-master` starter but is reorganized into a modular workspace that highlights reusable patterns, extensive documentation, and integration points for GitHub-powered workflows.

## Highlights

- **Agentic developer experience** with a left-rail conversation history and shadcn-inspired UI components.
- **GitHub-native automation** allowing the worker to curate, modify, and surface repository assets.
- **Secure API gateway** guarded by `env.WORKER_API_KEY` for GitHub Actions and automation pipelines.
- **D1-backed knowledge base** for assistant prompts and repository discovery digests.
- **Pluggable AI patterns** including RAG pipelines, Durable Object conversation stores, and orchestrated summarization workflows.

> **Note:** The code in this monorepo is intentionally rich with docstrings and comments to serve as a reference implementation and teaching resource. Replace the placeholder implementations with production-grade logic as you wire up your own services.
